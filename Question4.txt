Value 1 is: daf3ec0c. Value 2 is daf3ec0c
String 1 is: 744329261. String 2 is -715285062
Notes:
Took about 45 Seconds using two random int generators

Value 1 is: dc0ee129. Value 2 is dc0ee129
String 1 is: 6F35BFFEBFC9DBEF891DB56E786A34D2. String 2 is -4925183664276030463
Notes: 
Ran for 20 minutes using a random int generator with no luck , the numbers visibly cycled all possible integers (11 billion iterations)
Changed int generators to long generators, value appeared in 15 minutes
For both scenarios, computer calulcated about 10 million iterations/ second
