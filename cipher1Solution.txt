Notes:
Tried ceaser cipher for all 26 possibilities, did not work.
Noticed reoccuring words (PAM), this would not be the case with a polygraph cipher

Deduced monograph cipher.

Used frequency analysis right away using self built program that takes in a key and text, began to nit pick at words and eventually just kept swapping to find the key.
